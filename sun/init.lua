-- SunScript, a transpiled language built ontop of Lua.
-- The goal of SunScript is to allow computers to build an intellisense
-- procedurally during programming, and to make Lua more readable.

-- A bit of caution, the code below was put together while I was still learning how to use LPEG.
-- As such, the code is quite messy and uses really bad LPEG syntax.
-- A rewrite is necessary.
